# InstagramBotUnfollowUnfollowers
An Instagram automation tool using Python 3.11 and Selenium , to automate the process of finding who unfollowed you and automatically start unfollowing them back.

# JSONParser
To run this script successfully you will need two files , followers.txt and following.txt , which you can request to get from Instagram. You will download them in JSON format and then use the JSONParser (https://github.com/manetosx/JSONParser) I have written to extract the data you need and save it in the required text files. After that you need to place those text files in the same directory as the unfollowScript , and you're good to go.

# Dependencies
Make sure you have successfully installed Selenium otherwise the script won't execute properly.

# To install latest version of Selenium
python3 -m pip install selenium
